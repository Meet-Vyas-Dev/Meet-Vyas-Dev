## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Meet Vyas. I am naturally very curious, which has made me delve into several disciplines and activities, the details of which can be found on [my personal website](https://meet-vyas-dev.github.io/)

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on computational astrophysics and early universe cosmology.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning mathematical general relativity, astronomical software development, and reading about philosophy and Indian literature. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on some projects on gravitational waves and number theory, which can be further inquired by mailing me at [meet.v2 [at] ahduni.edu.in](mailto:meet.v2@ahduni.edu.in)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can either reach out to me by mail, which is the easiest, or you can also reach out to me on social media, the links to which can be found on my personal website. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have been playing guitar for the past 14 years and can play any song by ear.
